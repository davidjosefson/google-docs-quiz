Google Docs Quiz-script
=================================

If you have a lot of quiz questions in your Google Docs-document and want to be tested on the questions in a random order - neatly presented, without the need to scroll through the page? 
Look no further!

The script assumes you have written the questions as numbered lists, each new question as a new list with the answers indented below each question.
Example:

1. How did Einstein die?
  a. He was shot to death
  b. with a gun

2. What are the two most important things in the world?
  a. I don't
  b. know
